### JPACRUDProject

### Overview
This web application allows a user to insert an RPG game character into a database
as well as gives the user the ability to edit the character or delete it from the
database all together.

### How to Use
To begin the user will be greeted and see a link to create a character. Upon clicking
this link the user will be taken to a page containing a form in which they can
insert all the data necessary to create a new character in the database. Once this
information is submitted the user will receive a message letting them know if the
insert succeeded or failed. If the new character is added successfully the user
will also see the information about the character they just made as well as being
presented with the option to edit the character or delete it. The edit character
button will direct a user to a form identical to the creation form except the
name field will already be populated with the current name. Allowing the user
to see what they are changing. If delete is selected the character will simply
be removed from the database and a message will be displayed confirming this.

### Lessons Learned (pos/neg)
Positive: Where to begin with this weeks project.. What a pleasure it has been.
I spent hours and hours trying to debug methods and get front end to work with my
back end data. Even though I did get caught up quite a bit never once was I fed up
with staring at the code and teaching myself new things and working on new ways to
problem solve. It was almost like working on a puzzle or brain teaser. It pushed
me further and has definitely succeeded in helping me piece together important
concepts and every time I look back at where I was several weeks ago I just grow
more eager to see where the coming weeks take me.
Negative: That being said this project truly challenged me and left me stumped
very often. I'm not entirely satisfied with the final product and it is something
I wish to continue developing so that I may piece together the concepts that I was
stuck on this weekend. I know I can do better, I will continue to push myself and
get the outcome I am searching for.
